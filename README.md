This project is based on original work by Laura Luebbert. The initial code was authored and structured by her, and I would like to acknowledge their contribution as the foundation of this implementation.

Modifications Made
Since using the original code, I have made several adaptations to better suit my working environment and specific requirements, including but not limited to:

Transitioning the codebase from macOS-specific functionality to Windows-compatible operations.

Refactoring sections of the code to improve usability and convenience in my workflow.

Debugging and enhancing certain parts of the logic to ensure stability and clearer output.

Making other minor edits and reorganizations for maintainability.

All modifications were made with the intent to preserve the core structure and spirit of the original code while making it better suited for my context.
